                <h1>Who is it from?</h1>
                <p>We run a company called <a href="https://www.replicated.com">Replicated</a> that enables SaaS applications to create an enterprise installable version of their product to be distributed behind the firewall. Weâ€™ve
                    built and sold a SaaS
                    company previously. We work closely with many SaaS founders and teams. In order to be successful with the Replicated platform, SaaS companies generally need a baseline of features that enterprise customers want.
                    We've led the charge
                    on much of the content, but we've been lucky to have contributers like the teams at <a href="https://www.segment.com">Segment</a> and <a href="https://www.jaspersoft.com">TIBCO Jaspersoft</a> to contribute to
                    areas where they're
                    experts.

                <p>We're product people. So, we're changing the enterprise software narrative from "how to <strong>SELL</strong> to the enterprise" to "how to <strong>BUILD</strong> for the enterprise." Hopefully this site can create
                    a common vernacular
                    for founders, product managers, engineers, sales and customers alike. We know we're not always right... so we <a href="https://github.com/enterpriseready/enterpriseready">open sourced this</a>, you can fork it,
                    create edits, share
                    it with your team and even contribute those back.</p>
