      <description>Google Apps for Work provides a robust audit trail to both Standard and Unlimited accounts. By default, the feature is only available to Admins. Non-admin users have no way to view their personal audit history. Google categorizes their audit trail as a type of report, so it is available under the Reports menu.
For the Standard Plan, audit logs are available for Admin activities, Logins, Calendar activities, Tokens, Groups, and Email log search.</description>

      <description>Google Apps for Work is the business focused version of the popular and free to consumers, Google Apps products shown below:
All of these products can be used for free by just creating a Gmail account, however the free version lacks all of the EnterpriseReady features.
Unlike many other SaaS applications, there is no upgrade path from the free version to a paid account. In order to use Google Apps for Work a company administrator must register an organization and either buy or prove ownership of a domain name theyâ€™d like to use with the service.</description>
