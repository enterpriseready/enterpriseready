      <description>Slack was quite proactive in preparing for the European Commissionâ€™s enactment of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), seemingly doing everything that is required to comply with the law and also to inform customers about how Slack will help them comply. This is includes table-stakes efforts such as creating a dedicated GDPR website and entering into Data Processing Addenda with both its customers and its vendors.
In order to reassure customers that their data will be safe with Slack, and that their use of Slack complies with GDPR guidelines, Slack also uses its GDPR website to highlight its security certifications and practices, as well as its certification under both the EU-US Privacy Shield and Swiss-US Privacy Shield frameworks.</description>

      <description>Slack leverages vertical product assortment to create different packages that meet the needs of different customer segments. The packages are primarily defined by the features they add. Just like most SaaS applications, those features generally fall into the EnterpriseReady feature categories as illustrated below.
The Free tier limits the quantity of integrations, searchable messages and file storage space. If any threshold is hit then the price bumps up to $8 per user per month.</description>

      <description>Slack supports a variety of different login options: standard user-based login, OAuth login with Google Accounts, or SAML login. Slack also has managed to provide a good process to converting an account from one login system to another.
On the administration page of a Slack team, there is an option to select Google Apps or SAML. It should be noted that Slack has different pricing tiers and the middle tier allows you to access the Google Apps login option, and you must be on the highest tier to access the SAML option.</description>

      <description>Slack has done a remarkable job keeping up with its fast growth, and that extends to how the company has implemented its customer support and SLA offerings. Generally speaking, Slack handles support exactly how you might think it would: the more money you pay, the higher level of support you get. In the Slack for Teams product, free plans get standard support, mid-tier plans get priority support, and the highest tier (called Plus) receives 24/7 support.</description>
