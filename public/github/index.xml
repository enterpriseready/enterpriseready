      <description>GitHub offers their Enterprise customers additional features for reporting that are not available in standard editions. Because GitHub is a tool for code management, the intended audience is almost always technical, so GitHub have the advantage of being able to offer their data access in fairly complex ways like APIs. A tool that is geared towards teachers would not get away with offering most of data access in the form of APIs and would likely have to spend more development cycles providing reports.</description>

      <description>GitHub offers their application to customers with a few different deployment options. The vast majority of GitHub&amp;rsquo;s customers run on GitHub.com (in terms of quantity, but not necessarily in terms of revenue), this is the multi-tenant, cloud hosted version of their application. Individuals sign up for accounts and then are added to organizations when they join a new company. Organizations will generally have a mix of private and public repos with varying access based on the users role.</description>
