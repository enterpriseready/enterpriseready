## (Work in progress…)
Enterprises have a large number of applications and data sources. It is integral for those applications to be able to work together. While having a well documented API is an important foundation necessary for achieving interoperability, the easier integrations are to turn on, the more adoption you’ll see.

### Basics:
Integration platforms - Mule (from MuleSoft), Zapier, Tray.io
Integrate closely into the big apps that most enterprises use (point integrations).
Enable data to flow to other systems to avoid becoming "another damn dashboard"
Provide a status page or /ping so that your application can participate in the global ecosystem.
Admin override - enable admins to enable/disable integrations of individual users
Settings screen - all integrations should be controlled from a settings page where they can be managed.
Integrating with standards - follow standards for output to enable integrations to any conforming application
Consider the global data model - the information within your application will need to be combined with a set of data from external applications. It is important to enable your customers to include a global unique identifier for each entity and resource.

## Advanced:
Enterprises use different applications than most individual developers or small business users. This is actually an interesting place where you can charge your customers more for various integrations.
Provide detailed and regularly updated documentation that explicitly shows how to enable various integrations (most require some screenshots of the integrating service).

[Segment.com](http://segment.com/) and many other integration focused companies actually group the various applications that customers are integrating with into buckets… if a customer is using a piece of Oracle’s suite they know they’re spending a lot of money on that software so they can bucket it into a higher priced plan.
