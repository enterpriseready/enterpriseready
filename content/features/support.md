## SLA (Service Level Agreement)
### Uptime
This is a common request from enterprise customers. Generally they’ll want a contractual guarantee that your service will be in service 99.9% of the time… they might even push for "five 9s… 99.999%. This is less of a product feature, but the likely solution to achieving high availability often lies in being able to run your application in multiple availability regions. It is important to report this with some amount of historical transparency. A services like [StatusPage](statuspage.io) or [Status.io](https://status.io) can be used to maintain the historical record of availability.

### Response time
Within this SLA you’ll also likely find your commitment to provide support hours, emergency support and response times. Response times vary by the severity of the issue that is being raised. Severity is often categorized into Sev1, Sev2, Sev3 with clear definitions for the issues that will fall into each category. Application downtime with no work around is a clear Sev1 issue, potential security vulnerabilities are generally elevated to Sev1 as well. Response times for Sev1 is likely under 3 hours. Response is defined as the time it takes for a qualified team member to acknowledge the issue and begin to diagnose the problem.

## Support
Community-based support, email, phone, dedicated customer success manager. This seems to be the easiest way for SaaS companies to differentiate their various plans.

## Training
Docs, videos, tutorials, in-person training.

## Roadmap
Your enterprise customers will expect some visibility into your roadmap. They want to be able to shape the features that you’ll be adding to ensure that you continue to meet their changing needs.

## Additional contractual requests
Your customers will eventually ask for things like business insurance, source code escrow and indemnification. These aren’t really product features but they’re important to understand as they’ll come up in enterprise contract negotiations. They’ll also need to understand that your product is built with application security in mind, often the deliverable is an application security document. Tactical: A few great law blogs & your lawyer.

Developer mechanics: 1) How to deal with source code escrow. 2) How to document your architecture, think about threat modeling and deliver a technical product security document.
