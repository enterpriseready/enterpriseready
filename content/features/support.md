## (Work in progress…)
## SLA (Service Level Agreement)
### Uptime
This is a common request from enterprise customers. Generally they’ll want a contractual guarantee that your service will be in service 99.9% of the time… they might even push for "five 9s… 99.999%. This is less of a product feature, but the likely solution to achieving high availability often lies in being able to run your application in multiple availability regions. Example: Heroku; Tactical: NewRelic SLA Reporting & Zendesk/support tools

### Response time
Within this SLA you’ll also likely find your commitment to provide support hours, emergency support and response times.

## Support
Community-based support, email, phone, dedicated customer success manager.

## Training
Docs, videos, tutorials, in-person training.

## Roadmap
Your enterprise customers will expect some visibility into your roadmap. They want to be able to shape the features that you’ll be adding to ensure that you continue to meet their changing needs.

## Additional contractual requests
Your customers will eventually ask for things like business insurance, source code escrow and indemnification. These aren’t really product features but they’re important to understand as they’ll come up in enterprise contract negotiations. They’ll also need to understand that your product is built with application security in mind, often the deliverable is an application security document. Tactical: A few great law blogs & your lawyer.

Developer mechanics: 1) How to deal with source code escrow. 2) How to document your architecture, think about threat modeling and deliver a technical product security document.
