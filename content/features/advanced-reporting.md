Reporting is an important feature for enterprise buyers because it allows them (or the administrator) to prove the value that they have provided (justifying their salary) as well as prove that the software in itself was effective (justifying the price they paid). It isn’t enough for software to be effective, it has to be provably effective. The more ways you enable customers to slice and manipulate the data that your application produces, the more likely that they’ll be able to prove effectiveness.

## Usage Reporting
At the most basic level you need reporting. Reporting tells your customer what happened. Make sure that this can be dumped to excel. Many of these are the same core usage stats that you’re likely tracking internally to understand if your product is successful as a whole… just segmented for each individual team. The more charts/graphs you provide the better the story that your customer can tell inside the organization.

## Analytics
The next level is analytics. Analytics gives your customers an understanding of what to expect in the future. Analytics generally go deeper than how the product is being used. Instead, analytics gives your customer key insights into their business based on the data that your application collects.
