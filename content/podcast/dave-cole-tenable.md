Welcome back to the EnterpriseReady Podcast! Today our guest is Davle Cole, who at the time of recording was the Chief Product Officer at Tenable, but has recently left to start a stealthy startup in the security space. This episode is long, but that’s because Dave has such a great history of bringing enterprise software to market and there were so many topics for us to dig into. Dave shares his 18 years of experience building world class products in the security space. We focus a lot of time on his role at Tenable, include what is required to manage a product portfolio (vs just one product), preparing a product org for an IPO, setting up and managing a Customer Advisory Board, and ways to drive product communication inside of a large organization. I hope you enjoy our conversation!

EnterpriseReady is hosted by Grant Miller, creator of EnterpriseReady and co-founder and CEO of [Replicated](https://www.replicated.com), who are powering the worlds best enterprise software.
