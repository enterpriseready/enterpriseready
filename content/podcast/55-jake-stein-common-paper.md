In this episode, Jake Stein (co-founder of Common Paper, Stitch, and RJMetrics) joins Grant Miller to talk through the evolution of B2B contracts and how software—particularly AI—is transforming the sales process. Jake shares the origin story of Common Paper, lessons learned from previous startups, and how he’s leveraging AI with their new product to streamline contract negotiations and redlines. The two dive into the importance of standardization, what’s “market” in enterprise contracts, and why faster sales cycles are a major growth lever. A must-watch for SaaS founders, sales leaders, and legal ops pros.
