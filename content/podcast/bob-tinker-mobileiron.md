In this episode of the EnterpriseReady podcast, I sit down with [Bob Tinker](https://twitter.com/BobTinker), co-founder of MobileIron, a company that he served as CEO of, from founding through IPO before stepping down in 2016. Bob recently co-authored a book called [Survival to Thrival](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1684014905/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_ep_dp_xdAJAbN1FE6VQ), in which he lays out the foundations for building and growing an enterprise software company. We focus on several of the frameworks that Bob developed for building a go-to-market playbook, including how to determine your best go to market approach, and how to continuously evolve your company in a fast-changing market. We also discuss the importance of customer urgency and playing to your wow features. I think anyone building a modern enterprise software company is really going to appreciate this episode.

EnterpriseReady is hosted by Grant Miller, creator of EnterpriseReady and co-founder and CEO of [Replicated](https://www.replicated.com), who are powering the worlds best enterprise software.
