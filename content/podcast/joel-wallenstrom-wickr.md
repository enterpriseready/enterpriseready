In this episode of the EnterpriseReady podcast, we sit down Joel W. CEO of Wickr, a secure messaging and communications platform. We learn a bit about Joel’s background in the cyber security industry, with a focus on his time running 3rd party security firms. From there, we dive into the history of Wickr, which started as a consumer, mobile first communications tool on the back of perfect forward secrecy. We talk about the process of bringing a consumer product to enterprises, with a focus on SSO, on-prem deployment, and enterprise MDM (that all mobile first companies should probably pay attention to).

EnterpriseReady is hosted by Grant Miller, creator of EnterpriseReady and co-founder and CEO of [Replicated](https://www.replicated.com), who are powering the worlds best enterprise software.
