In this episode of the EnterpriseReady podcast we sit down with [Rahul Vohra](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rahulvohra/), founder and CEO of [Superhuman](https://superhuman.com/). Superhuman recently announced a $33m series B from A16Z which was their first funding announcement despite having raised over $17m previously. I have Rahul give us some details about his fundraising history and strategy which is quite unique.  Rahul and I spend a lot of time discussing his experience of building software to solve problems that individuals encounter in the day-to-day work. However, Rahul’s approach to bringing these solutions to market is quite different than most enterprise software companies. As such, Superhuman is defining a new category that can be described as “prosumer in the enterprise”. We talk about what that entails as well as how it impacts other parts of the business including how they survey, select and onboard users through a 1-on-1 introductory call so all users can become power users. This is definitely a bit of unique enterprise ready podcast, but hopefully you’ll enjoy Rahul’s perspective on a different way to think about enterprise go-to-market approaches.

EnterpriseReady is hosted by Grant Miller, creator of EnterpriseReady and co-founder and CEO of [Replicated](https://www.replicated.com), who are powering the worlds best enterprise software.
