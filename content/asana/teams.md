Asana is one of the premier project management tools amongst the sea of PM applications. Asana’s application is designed to help teams improve communication, organization and collaboration. This makes it a great service to analyze for Team functionality.

We know any product that introduces [Team](/features/teams) functionality is trying to promote collaboration, but let’s see what Teams look like when the entire mission of the product is collaboration.

Asana’s Project feature is where users live and breath. Creating a Project is intended to help users reach a certain goal. Within a project you’ll have multiple tasks. You can quickly see how you’d want to introduce multiple users to a Project where there is a shared goal between users. Asana solves this two ways: Workspaces and Organizations.

### Workspaces vs. Organizations vs. Teams
Asana accounts are free and tied to individuals; Asana accounts grant access to shared Workspaces and Organizations to collaborate with other Asana users. With a single Asana account, you can create or join multiple Workspaces & Organizations to collaborate with various groups of Asana users; these Workspaces and Organizations you belong to are their own separate entities, each with their own unique set of people, projects, and tasks.

#### Workspace
A workspace is for individual accounts that aren’t associated with an Organization. Multiple Asana users can be a part of a workspace but

#### Organization
For every email address associated with a unique domain name Asana creates an Organization. This is the foundation of their Teams functionality.

#### Teams
Once inside of an Asana Organization teams can be created. Asana allows for the creation of multiple teams within a single organization (i.e. Support Team, Marketing Team, Engineering Team, etc…).

### Signing Up
Sign up with either an Email or Google App Account.

### Onboarding a New User within an Organization
When a new user signs up with a unique domain email address associated with an existing Organization they are automatically pulled into that Organization. They are asked which team inside of the organization they’d like to join.

If you choose not to join any existing teams the next step Asana presents is a way to invite more people to your newly formed team via email address.

Asana then allows you to create a unique name for that team.
