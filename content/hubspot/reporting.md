HubSpot's products are about end-to-end demand generation and lead management. Marketing is a role that requires a lot of analytics and marketing people tend to be less technical. This means that in order to provide data to eyeballs the ability to let users define their own reports and analytics is critical.

## Product Assortment
The three plans that HubSpot offers (Basic, Pro, Enterprise) are interesting to study from an analytics assortment point of view - clearly some thought went into how the plans are designed. Enterprise editions are the only ones that offer revenue, custom event-based, contacts and companies reporting.

In addition to the standard reports in the packages, HubSpot offers a reporting add-on for an additional 7.5% of the value of the Enterprise edition.

## Reporting Add-On
Custom reporting lets users define their own reports and dashboards directly into the product based on any metric in the Marketing or CRM products, all without technical expertise.

Customers can choose from a library of templates or build their own custom visual reports that can be previewed and allow selection of chart types. The reports can then be arranged into dashboard tiles and saved.

Dashboards can then be scheduled to send daily, weekly, or monthly emails.
