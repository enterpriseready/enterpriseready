“Deployment Best Practices” examines the challenges and opportunities that arise as the unprecedented portability of applications meets enterprises’ heterogeneous deployment needs across verticals. Beginning with a discussion of how deployment practices have evolved for each of their teams, the panelists in this video assess how product functionality can be built to accommodate multiple states of cloud adoption (on-prem, cloud SaaS, hybrid cloud) in customers’ environments.

Deployments must often balance agile feature integrations with stable overall functionality, all while satisfying an enterprise’s particular installation parameters. Vendors, therefore, must mobilize mechanisms that provide consistent value by responding to the distinct needs of customers’ current platform architectures. These paths to deployment can often be tricky. With on-prem customers, for instance, difficulties might arise in negotiating the frequency and necessity of painful upgrades, while customers who want cloud SaaS or hybrid cloud deployments may request the option to run both inside and outside of private clouds, even if their current needs don’t require it.

How can startups best satisfy these divergent, fluctuating needs? Meet the customer where they are, and be ready and willing to move with them. Along the way, focus on conversations with team members who can most accurately articulate their company’s requirements, such as customer success, TAMs, and solutions/sales engineers.
